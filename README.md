# Weather-App

## Description

This is a simple web-based Weather App that pulls weather data from OpenWeather API. Users can effortlessly explore both the current conditions and the 5-day forecast for any city of their preference. Ideal for trip planning, the app conveniently retains a search history, enabling users to revisit and review their previous searches.

2. **Search History**: After each search, a 'search history' will begin to populate right below the search button. Having a 'search history' will allow the user to look up earlier searches.
